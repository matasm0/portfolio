        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <div class="section text-s">
            <p>PW is a password manager built using python that runs in the terminal. It features all of the important functions
                of any good password manager: adding/checking/removing passwords, as well as generating random secure passwords.
                <br><br>It encrypts the password file with a master password that you provide, ensuring that your passwords aren't
                visible to any other programs or attackers who may get their hands on it. Additionally, it automatically backs up the
                password file, in case anything goes wrong. Restoring from these backups is quick and easy. Similarly, it is easy to
                move your passwords file across devices, and you can even put the file into your cloud storage to have it sync immediately
                from anywhere. Check out more on the github page above.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2>The Why</h2>
        <div class="section text-s">
            pw was the first real personal project I undertook after learning python. I had always wanted a password manager, but never
            trusted giving other companies by information. Makes sense then, right, to just make my own? My first iteration was the opposite
            of secure, happily storing the passwords file in plaintext. Could be considered a slight security risk. <br><br>
            My second and current iteration remedies this, as well as adding more features like backups. The new program takes a single master
            password to unencrypt the password file. The file is encrypted using the password as the key, running the python library cryptography's
            Fernet algorithm. 
        </div>
        <h2>The Why Not</h2>
        <div class="section text-s">
            While I had to learn a little bit about cryptography and computer security while making this program, I would say that that knowledge
            made me less confident in the product I built, not more. The amount and type of attacks that are possible are far beyond the realm of my
            understanding, as are the tools people have built to combat it. I do not claim to be an expert in computer security; I do not even claim to
            be mediocre. This is a serious field and the actual security should be left to the actual experts. There are plenty of free password managers
            out there that do everything this does and more, and better. These sites can definitely be trusted, and the benefits of having a password
            manager far outweighs the risks that come from centralizing all of your passwords.<br><br>
            With that being said, I do still actually use this daily as my password manager. Do as I say, not as I do.
        </div>
        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <div class="section text-s">
            In the process of building this project, I learned quite a bit about computer security and how passwords are stored securely by these other
            more professional password managers. If I were to expand on this project, I would create an online version, similar to how Bitwarden does their
            security.

        <h2>Showcase</h2>
        <div class="section text-s">
            <p>When starting the application, it checks whether or not the password file exists. Currently, this is hardcoded,
                but the infrastructure is in place to allow the user to change this in the config. The application will prompt the user for a password,
                and create the new password file.
            </p>
            <div class="img-holder">
                <div>
                    <img id="start1" src="../../imgs/pw-start1.png" alt="Program asking for password">
                    <div class="text-xxs alt"><i>Program asks for password</i></div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                Once done, the main menu is displayed. Typing any of the options takes you into that function.
            </p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Typing quit at any point brings you back to the main menu.</p>
            <div class="img-holder">
                <div>
                    <img id="menu2" src="../../imgs/pw-menu2.png" alt="User types q, program returns to main menu">
                    <div class="text-xxs alt"><i>User typed "q", returns to main menu</i></div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>The application can generate a password using "gen", or when creating a new account. The characters used in the password can be changed
                inside of the function, in case the site does not allow certain characters.
            </p>
            <div class="img-holder">
                <div>
                    <img id="gen1" src="../../imgs/pw-gen1.png" alt="Program generating random 12 character passwords">
                    <div class="text-xxs alt"><i>Program generating random 12 character passwords</i></div>
                </div>

            </div>
            <p>If you already know the inputs you need, you can immediately type it all in as an input stream.
                By default, the master password cannot be taken in this way, but the "-l" flag followed by your password
                bypasses this.<br><br>
                An example, if we have a google account added, we can run "python3 pw -l hello check google", where "hello" is our
                master password. The program will output the account's username and email, while copying the password to the clipboard.
            </p>
            <div class="img-holder">
                <div>
                    <img id="check1" src="../../imgs/pw-check1.png" alt="Program outputting user's username and email">
                    <div class="text-xxs alt"><i>Result of above input stream</i></div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>More advanced example, running "python3 pw -l hello add facebook bob bob@gmail.com bob123" immediately creates a new account
                for Facebook. "hello" is the master password in this case, and "bob" is the username, "bob@gmail.com" is the email, "bob123" is
                the password for the account.
            </p>
            <div class="img-holder">
                <div>
                    <img id="check2" src="../../imgs/pw-check2.png" alt="Program showing newly created facebook account">
                    <div class="text-xxs alt"><i>Running check on the program shows the new account</i></div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>The application makes several backups to hopefully prevent total data loss. A way to restore backups from the program itself
                is a work in progress but for now you just replace the old passwords file. The backups are stored by default in the backups/ directory in
                the same directory as the pw script. Choose the backup you want, and move it to where your pwd.txt file is. Delete your old pwd.txt, and rename
                the backup to pwd.txt. The program will now use that file instead.
