        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <div class="section text-s">
            <p>
                GDrive Viewer is a commandline application that syncs your
                Google Drive cloud account onto your local disk. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2>The Why</h2>
        <div class="section text-s">
            A while back, I had switched over to Linux for TheOdinProject, a free online WebDev program. It turns out
            that there isn't (or wasn't) an official Google Drive for Desktop like there was on Windows, and I really
            missed the convenience of it. I decided it would be a good experience, and so ignoring other better methods
            such as rclone or wine, I set off to reinvent the wheel.
        </div>
        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <div class="section text-s">
            Google provides a lot of good documentation for their services, and it was a great opportunity to learn how
            to read the documentation and solve problems using it. Since nobody else seemed to want to take on the task
            of creating a worse version of something that already exists, it was necessary that I could figure out my own
            solutions given what was on the documentation. <br><br>
            Another great skill I developed was working with APIs. At this point, I had some experience with APIs, but the
            bulk of it was just making calls to my own servers. This was a good opportunity to work with a professional API,
            with proper error checking/message sending and all that good stuff. I learned a lot about RESTful APIs, and am far
            more confident in working with other APIs in the future. <br><br>
            This project also helped a lot with my problem solving as well as planning skills as I did not expect it to turn
            out so complex. Making sure that changes made to the cloud are reflected locally while at the same time making sure
            changes made locally are reflected to the cloud is a more difficult manuever than I originally imagined. I still have
            a lot to work on but I feel like it has had a positive impact on the way I write new projects.
