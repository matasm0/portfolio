        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <div class="section text-s">
            <p>
                The goal of the project was to make a website where users can create an account, log in, make
                posts, and comment on other people's posts. It is similar in form and function to the social media
                website 9gag. I was expected to keep track of all of the users, as well as all of the posts and
                who had posted/interacted with them. This allows a user who liked a post to see that liked status
                across multiple sessions.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Tools Used</h2>
        <div class="section text-s">
            <p>
                The main tool used in the creating the project was React, a JavaScript library that alters the way
                websites are coded. Instead of dealing with separate HTML, CSS and JavaScript files, React
                provides components that can be used to build the design and functionality of the site. This
                means objects like buttons can be created and have their effects customized right in the same
                bit of code. It also works very well with CSS preprocessors, libraries that allow CSS to be written
                in a form more akin to a standard programming language, unlocking loops and more flexible
                variables. <br><br>
                Bootstrap is a CSS framework that provides decent looking defaults for many common
                components, as well as giving easy ways to customize the looks for many different objects at
                once. For example, if the primary color of the site was green, and now you want it to be blue,
                changing the whole site is as simple as changing one variable. This provided the baseline for
                many of the HTML components. <br><br>
                The main backend tool used in the project is Express. It is a library that provides a server with
                RESTful (HTTP) API calls that can be easily implemented. It can be used with actual live remote
                servers, but in my case, I just run it locally with local server code.
                For the storage of user data, I initially used MongoDB. It is a cloud storage platform built around
                providing easy to access and understand databases for servers. Models can be created for the
                data, which are templates that ensure that all data going into the database are of a certain type,
                and contain all of the required information. So a user model would have a username field that is
                of type string. <br><br>
                For storage, I also used SQLite, a lightweight local SQL database library. It does everything a
                normal SQL database does, while fitting easily inside applications as it is just a library instead of
                its own app.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Showcase</h2>
        <div class="section text-s">
            <p>
                As a user of the site, you are initially taken to the home page, where you can either sign up for an
                account or log into an existing one.
            </p>
            <div class="img-holder">
                <div>
                    <img src="../../imgs/oc_p7-main2.png" alt="">
                    <div class="text-xxs alt"><i>Home page</i></div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                Once in, the user can change their profile picture and their username, but can also choose not
                to and use the beautiful default profile picture and their email as their username. These can both
                be changed at any time.
            </p>
            <div class="img-holder">
                <div>
                    <img src="../../imgs/oc_p7-create1.png" alt="">
                    <div class="text-xxs alt"><i>User creation screen</i></div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                They are then taken to the main post page, where they can see all of the posts from other users
                in a scrollable list. Posts will appear light purple if they have not been read (clicked), and gray if
                they have. Above the posts is a button that allows the user to filter out all of the posts they have
                already read.
            </p>
            <div class="img-holder">

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                Each post has its own page, where users can interact by posting comments on the post itself as
                well as comments on other users' comments.
            </p>
            <div class="img-holder">

                    <div class="text-xxs alt"><i>Post page with example comments</i></div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                Every user has their own page where they can see posts and comments that they've or others
                made, along with posts and comments that they have liked. If they are on their own user page,
                they can also edit their username and profile picture here.
            </p>
            <div class="img-holder">

            </div>
            <p>
                Luckily, as soon as you figure out this site isn't all its cracked up to be, you do have an easy one
                click no confirmation no take backs way to delete your account and forget the site ever existed.
