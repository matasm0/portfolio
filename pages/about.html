                <p class="text-s">For maybe the third time, hello! I'm Masato. I graduated from the University of California,
                    Riverside in the June of 2023. I majored in computer science, and finished the course with
                    a GPA of 3.41. I love all things tech, and have a passion for creating and learning.

            <h2 id="me">Who I am</h2>
            <div class="section">
                <p class="text-s">I'm a Japan born, half Japanese half African human being currently living on the planet Earth.
                    I came to America at a young age, and have lived here the large majority of my life. In my childhood,
                    I learned English from school and the people around me, as well as some Japanese at home (though I've
                    forgotten the vast majority of it...). My biggest responsibilities so far have been two pet hamsters
                    (RIP), which makes me adequately prepared to take on any task that is given to me.
                    <br><br>
                    I've loved tech and computers since I was little. I remember downloading <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>
                    and playing around using what limited knowledge and understanding I had. Sticking those logic blocks together and getting
                    increasingly upset as the cat did nothing that I wanted it to was a highlight that's stuck with me this whole time. 
                    I'm sure I made a beautifully well designed triple A game at some point, but I've since lost all those files so we'll never know.
                    Now, as an older and more experienced developer, I get to watch as my code inexplicably deletes the entire contents of my
                    google drive cloud... out of spite? Or a bug I made. Probably just spite. 
                    <br><br>Progress!<br><br>
                    On the hardware side, I've custom built 2 PCs for myself, both of which are still (somewhat) functional to this day.
                    Maybe its not too impressive anymore (there's many great tutorials out there), but as a professional thing breaker,
                    I think I deserve some credit. I've played around with a breadboard and Arduino, and even made a little "1D" racing game on
                    it. A line of LEDs on the board show you your proximity to walls, and your job is to make it around the racetrack with no other
                    information. I would love to get my hands on a Raspberry Pi someday as well.
                    <br><br>
                    Outside of programming, my hobbies include gaming as well as playing video games. I'm an avid enjoyer of fast paced high octane
                    games such as Minecraft and Tetris. A connoisseur, even. I also dabble in rhythm games, in which I am spectacularly mediocre.
                    All of this is, of course, solely for research purposes. How would one know how to develop software if they did not also use it?
                    But of course, I have other hobbies as well! Including...

                <p class="text-s">For formal education, I initially got into UCR as a math major. As much as I love math (I don't), I made sure to take the entry computer science courses
                    and switched my major at the start of my second year. The program at UCR teaches C++ in the lower level introductory courses, but
                    many of the more advanced courses introduce other languages and technologies depending on what was being taught. I've worked with:

                <ul id='div1' class="text-s">
                    <li>Operating Systems. Using the RISC-V educational CPU/kernel, I've implemented basic things such as 
                        locks and process management/scheduling all the way to memory management and allocation.  
                    </li>
                    <li>Virtual Reality. Using the Unity game engine, I created a small experience that features strange Non Euclidean geometries that would not be possible
                        in the real world. Things such as tunnels that appeared shorter on the inside than outside, stuff like that.
                    </li>
                    <li>Embedded Systems. Learned state machines and how to use them for designing the function of machines, from traffic lights to arcade games.</li>
                    <li>Computer Security. <b>Ethically</b> hacked encrypted passwords, as well as reverse engineered software at the binary level to change the functionality.</li>

                <p class="text-s">
                    Outside of school, I took a certificate program with OpenClassrooms on Website Development. It was a 6 month program aimed at teaching web dev all the way
                    from the basics of HTML and CSS to more advanced technologies such as React. Since it was based on projects, I was able to immediately use anything I learned,
                    which made it far more effective than just reading about it in a textbook. I learned and used servers (Express), databases (SQL and NoSQL/MongoDB), frameworks (Bootstrap),
                    and standards such as REST for APIs. I learned how to safely take and handle user inputs, including the careful hashing/storing of passwords. Session cookies, local storage,
                    web token signing... all that and more.
                    <br><br>
                    In my own time, I learned Python with a friend, and it quickly became one of my favorite coding languages to use. It makes creating small scripts and 
                    apps incredibly easy. I'll touch on my projects more in the next section. It also helps that it is a lot friendlier than C++, doing a lot of the menial
                    tasks in the background. I've also messed with some mobile app development, using Google's Dart framework Flutter.

            <h2 id="experience">Experience</h2>
            <div class="section">
                <p class="text-s">I've just realized I've put all my school "experience" in the previous section, so I'll just mention my personal projects. I
                    actually enjoy coding outside of work/school (crazy) and I very much enjoy making my own software solutions to problems I may
                    face. Python gave me the ability to do that quickly and easily, and so most (all) of my coding projects are in Python.
                    <br><br>
                    My first project was a password manager to keep manage all of my passwords. I was suspicious of other websites keeping track of such
                    sensitive information, so I decided that it would be best if I handle it myself. This... is a terrible idea for many reasons. But who needs reason?
                    My first iteration did all the things one would want in a password manager, including creating accounts and even... generating passwords.
                    It had one small and insignificant issue that I'm sure could never result in security concerns. It had a funny little tendency of
                    storing all of your passwords in plain text. And then to further increase my attack surface, I made sure to upload this unencrypted plain text file,
                    containing very sensitive passwords such as my bank, onto my google drive. Since then I have worked on a new iteration of the program, which actually
                    encrypts the password file and does more cool things like backups. For your health and safety, I have not uploaded the code for the first iteration, but
                    if you are curious you can check out the current program <a href="">here.</a> This project taught me a lot of the basics of python, as well as
                    encryption and the vastly complicated field of computer security.
                    <br><br>
                    Continuing the trend of making worse versions of apps that already exist, my biggest project is my version of the Google Drive for Desktop app but on
                    Linux. The app wasn't available when I switched to Linux, which was devastating since it had been such a convenient tool. It taught me a lot about working
                    with actual APIs, and managing files. It is still a work in progress but you can see where it is at <a href="">here.</a>
                    <br><br>
                    The final project for the OpenClassrooms program was an example social media site, where users can create accounts and make posts/comments on those posts.
                    This was a great project as I had to create both the frontend and the backend for the website. This gave me experience working with APIs not only from the
                    client perspective but the end server perspective as well. 
                    <br><br>
                    Outside of coding, I have had two jobs, in fast food and in retail. While most of those skills obviously don't translate over well into a coding job,
                    I did get to learn and practice working under and with people for a common goal, as well as providing service and assistance for customers. People say I am
                    very hard working and dedicated, and I would like to agree. I always show up and perform to the best of my abilities, and always look for
                    opportunities to take the initiative to solve problems.
