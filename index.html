            <div id="about" class="content text-s">Hi again. I'm Masato, a recent graduate from the University of California, Riverside. 
                I majored in computer science and graduated with a 3.41 GPA.<br><br>
                Though I had some light coding experience before college, most of my knowledge comes from my 4 years at university. The program
                taught C++, and I later went on to learn Python by myself, as well as Javascript/HTML/CSS. Over that time, I created many different
                projects with many different languages and technologies, both in and out of school. I've worked with machine learning, operating systems,
                game development, web development; all the way down to reverse engineering and assembly.<br><br>
                My favorite thing to do with code is
                create programs that can help me in my day to day life, even if there may exist a better version of it already. I'm always eager to
                learn and use new technologies to help me achieve my goals.
                My dream is to create apps that people enjoy using, but most importantly, that I enjoy using.<br><br>
